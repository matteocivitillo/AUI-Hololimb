## Overview
**Hololimb** is a **Mixed Reality (MR) application** designed to help single-arm amputees manage **Phantom Limb Pain (PLP)** through immersive, non-pharmacological therapy. Developed for the **Meta Quest 3**, it allows users to visualize and interact with a **virtual phantom limb**, facilitating **mirror therapy** and **static therapy sessions**.

The app enables **at-home therapy**, improving accessibility beyond clinical settings. Users can:
- **Anchor a virtual limb** and customize its appearance.
- **Engage in exercises** to promote mental reconnection.
- **Switch between therapy modes** (Mirror Mode & Static Mode).
- **Use Passthrough mode** for a semi-augmented reality experience.

_Hololimb is currently in **beta version**, and we are working on further improvements._
